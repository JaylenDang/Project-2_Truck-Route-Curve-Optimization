# Project-2_Truck-Route-Curve-Optimization
This project was developed as part of a Hackathon organized by the UWA Young Engineers Club, in collaboration with Rio Tinto and BCG X. The goal of the project was to optimize the efficiency and safety of autonomous haul truck routes by improving road curve designs at intersections.
